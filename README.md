cslox是Lox语言的解释器，这是《[Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/)》中，第二部分的C#实现，原书在该部分介绍并制作了jlox，也就是java编写的Lox语言解释器，旨在专注于概念，正确的实现语法。

Cslox is the interpreter for the Lox language, which is the C# implementation in the second part of [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). In this section, the original book introduces and creates jlox, the Java-implemented Lox language interpreter, focusing on concepts and correctly implementing syntax.

还记得那本超厚超重的《编译原理》吗，它被叫做龙书，因为它的封面是一只龙

Do you remember that thick and heavy book **Compilers: Principles,Techniques,and Tools** ? It's called the Dragon Book because its cover features a dragon.

> Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.
